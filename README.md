This project contains an implementation of a maze generator and solver project.

The code in this project:
- Parses and reformats ASCII input
- Provides a visual representation of the ASCII input as a maze
- Solves the maze using the A* algorithm
- Animates a character moving through the maze along the A* path solution.

Next steps for this project would be:
- Accept user input during runtime
- Allow the user to choose which pathfinding algorithm they would like to use based on their inputted maze. This project could have an educational objective, allowing users to compete to choose and learn which algorithms work best in certain use-cases.
- Animate the character more thoroughly
